# Theme pack support for Sailfish OS

Theme pack support in Sailfish OS.

## Create custom theme packs

Wiki on how to correctly hook theme packs available [here](https://github.com/fravaccaro/themepacksupport-sailfishos/wiki/Get-started).

## Side notes

The script works replacing default elements with custom ones and enables safe backup/restore. I chose this approach as no proper documentation on theming support in Sailfish OS has been found yet.

However, a rudimentary theme support may have been already built-in, since I found jolla-ambient folders to have an index.theme package and dconf to have values for those themes. Further investigation is needed.
